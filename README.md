This is a calendar application to make planning your work day easier.

The user is able to add events to their 9-5 schedule, and recall them on a later date by using local storage. 

As the day progresses, the styling of the calendar is dynamically changed to always display the current hour. 

An API to the openweather API is being made to retrieve the current temperature. In the future this will be updated to provide the user with hourly weather conditions to help plan their events.
